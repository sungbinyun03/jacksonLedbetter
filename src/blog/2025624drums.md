Tuning shouldn’t feel like black magic. Below are five simple habits I use before every session or show.

## 1 · Seat the Heads Properly

1. Finger-tighten all lugs.  
2. Place moderate pressure in the center of the head.  
3. Use a star pattern to bring each lug up **¼-turn** at a time.

This lets the collar fully seat on the bearing edge and prevents weird overtones later.

## 2 · Equalize Lug Tension

Hold your stick about an inch from each lug and tap. If one spot sounds **higher**, loosen it a hair; if **lower**, tighten. Keep going until every tap matches pitch.

## 3 · Tune Bottom Head Slightly Higher

A resonant head a **minor third higher** than the batter gives you shorter sustain for live rooms while retaining punch on close-mics.

## 4 · Moongel vs. Tape

| Situation            | Best choice |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Live, loud stage     | Moongel     |
| Studio, soft ballad  | ½-inch gaffer tape over two lugs |

Both dampen over-ring, but tape lets you fine-trim sustain in tiny increments.

## 5 · Temperature Check

A head tuned at **68 °F** will drop almost a semitone if the stage is **90 °F**. Re-check your rack toms when the lights come up.

### TL;DR

| Step | Time | Impact |
|------|------|--------|
| Seat heads          | 2 min | 🌟🌟🌟🌟 |
| Equalize lugs       | 3 min | 🌟🌟🌟 |
| Bottom +3 semitones | 1 min | 🌟🌟 |
| Dampening           | 30 s  | 🌟 |
| Temp re-check       | 30 s  | 🌟 |

Stick to these and you’ll walk into any gig sounding like a record **before** the line-check even starts.
